### Playlists: <a name="playlists"></a>
Have a listen to some performances of the Winter 2024 lineup:
* **YouTube**: [YT Playlist: videos with Scores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SgJrqT4EUc&list=PLofraTZ-oauezKCJ2Ns2PntDHz2pm5eNT&pp=gAQBiAQB). I've made an effort to find videos showing the scores, but other performances are great.
* **Spotify**: [Eric's Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1BO6DD0onMDASXDBZ6j071?si=ac4ff15f6be14fa8). *(Great performances, curated by Eric Diller. Thanks, Eric!)* 

## Berlioz - Selections from Symphonie Fantastique <a name="berlioz"></a> <a name="berlioz-notes"></a>
We've settled on the two movements
* Movement 2: "Un Bal" *(A Ball)*,
* Movement 4: "Marche au Supplice" *(March to the Scaffold)*.

Here are some programme notes explaining the story behind the piece and why drugs are cool:
* [New York Philharmonic (PDF)](https://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1920/Berlioz-Symphonie-fantastique.pdf)
* [San Francisco Symphony (webpage)](https://www.sfsymphony.org/Data/Event-Data/Program-Notes/B/Berlioz-Symphonie-fantastique)

### Score and Parts: <a name="berlioz-parts"></a>
Please find the score and your parts here: [Berlioz - Symphonie Fantastique 2,4](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rHCdiKJQaKrATNqS1FSoXYMxGOuu8A9r). 

If there is no part for your instrument, you are *tacet* for the entire selection.

### MuseScore demo <a name="berlioz-musescore"></a>
Here are scores (with only the String + Harp parts) that can be used as a practice aid. The tempi, instruments included in the playback, etc. can all be adjusted, as shown in the tutorial section [here (not posted yet)](musescore-tutorial.md).
* [MuseScore: A Ball - String+Harp (Berlioz)](https://musescore.com/user/33269220/scores/13743490/s/mR2ZGy?share=copy_link)
* March to the Scaffold - (no link yet).

*Note: the last staff in all scores is there to fill in the melodies from other instrument parts that aren't also covered by the string section. It's a cue, but audio; I've omitted the other instrument parts from the complete score, since I haven't yet figured out how to make large scores legible in the online tool without constantly page adjustment.*

## St. Saens - Danse Macabre <a name="stsaens"></a> <a name="stsaens-notes"></a>
**Violins: please don't download/practice the part labelled "Solo"**. That part is played by the concertmaster only.

### Score and Parts: <a name="stsaens-parts"></a>
These are the parts that I originally uploaded: [Danse Macabre - originally uploaded ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qOTVnxxtOcg4IIOsZnWtQu0LE2e8D8j9). 

However, I realised that some parts are a bit hard to read, so here is another set: [Danse Macabre upload 2 - clearer PDFs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_o9T44W9HKEc-2QSLh_teWCSmVYbTcH3?usp=sharing). This folder also includes:
* Trumpets 1 and 2 in Bb,
* Horns 1,2,3 and 4 in F.

You can use whichever part you prefer; superficially they're the same.

### Landmarks: <a name="stsaens-landmarks"></a>
In the second upload above (clearer parts), both bar numbers and rehearsal letters are present. For the older parts, please copy in the following:
| **Rehearsal Letter**                        | **Bar Number** |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Tempo primo (flute entry after violin solo) | 33             |

### Score and Parts <a name="loewe-parts"></a>
Please refer to the email "Repertoire for the 2024 Winter Term" sent on 14 December 2023. I cannot post that link here, since that will make the parts available to everyone accessing this Readme. I'll sort the Google Drive permissions out differently next term.

No more necessary; everything is in the parts.
