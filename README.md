### Playlists: <a name="playlists"></a>
Have a listen to some performances of the Winter 2024 lineup:
* **YouTube**: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SgJrqT4EUc&list=PLofraTZ-oauezKCJ2Ns2PntDHz2pm5eNT&pp=gAQBiAQB). I've made an effort to find videos showing the scores, but other performances are great.
* **Spotify**: [Click here](). *(Interesting performances, curated by Eric Diller. Thanks, Eric!)* 

**I misplaced the spotify link - will ask Eric to resend**

## Berlioz - Selection from Symphonie Fantastique <a name="berlioz"></a> <a name="berlioz-perfnotes"></a>
We've settled on the two movements
* Movement 2: "Un Ball" *(A Ball)*,
* Movement 4: "Marche au Supplice" *(March to the Scaffold)*.

Here are some programme notes explaining the story behind the piece and why drugs are cool:
* [New York Philharmonic (PDF)](https://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1920/Berlioz-Symphonie-fantastique.pdf)
* [San Francisco Symphony (webpage)](https://www.sfsymphony.org/Data/Event-Data/Program-Notes/B/Berlioz-Symphonie-fantastique)

** will double as the performance notes section for each piece - I can pull information from the emails already sent **


### Score and Parts:  <a name="berlioz-parts"></a>
Find the parts here: [Parts (dead link until I figure out the best way to handle the Google Drive permissions)]().

If the part for your instrument is missing, you're *tacet* for the selection. Else, if you only play in one of the two pieces, I've left a note in your part.

### Landmarks:  <a name="berlioz-landmarks"></a>
Nick has kindly demanded that you copy these bar numbers/rehearsal letters into your part as soon as you can:

### MuseScore demo for Strings/Harp: <a name="berlioz-musescore"></a>
Here are scores (with only the String + Harp parts) that can be used as a practice aid. The tempi, instruments included in the playback, etc. can all be adjusted, as shown in the tutorial section [here (will be a separate file after I fill it in)](#musescore-tutorial).
* [A Ball - play-along](https://musescore.com/user/33269220/scores/13743490/s/mR2ZGy?share=copy_link)
* [March to the Scaffold - play-along (dead link)]()

*Note: the last staff in all scores is there to fill in the melodies from other instrument parts that aren't also covered by the string section. It's a cue, but audio; I've omitted the other instrument parts from the complete score, since I haven't yet figured out how to make large scores legible in the online tool without constantly page adjustment.*
